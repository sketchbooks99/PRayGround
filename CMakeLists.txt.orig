# Welcome to the OptiX SDK build.  We have chosen CMake, because it can generate multiple
# build systems for multiple architectures from a single script.  There are many resources
# for CMake on-line at http://www.cmake.org and their wiki page,
# http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake, in addition to the documentation that comes with the
# distribution.  There is also a book available if you wish to delve more deeply into
# various topics.

# If you wish to create your own project and use the SDK as a template there are a number
# of things you should do.
#
# 1. You should copy the contents of the SDK to a place of your choice.
#
# 2. You can remove any sample's directory you don't wish to build.  Be careful about
#    the following directories.
#
#    a. CMake - contains helper scripts that make this all work.  You should keep this.
#
#    b. sutil and putil
#              - Almost all of the samples make use of this shared code one way or another, so
#               you should probably keep them until you have your own frameowrk for your
#               code.
#
#    d. data  - This directory contains the cow.obj file used as an example for
#               many of the samples.  You can move cow.obj anywhere as long as
#               you fix all the file paths in the samples you wish to use it in.
#
# 3. You should update the list of sub directories that CMake needs to process below (look
#    for the comment "List of samples found in subdirectories.")
#

# The basic flow of execution of this file is to do the following.
#
# 1. Setup the project and other global settings.  This involves processing some helper
#    scripts.
#
# 2. Look for external dependencies, CUDA, and OptiX.
#
# 3. Process all the subdirectories' CMakeLists.txt files.  These files create all the
#    executable and library targets that are used to build the SDK.
#
# 4. As a convenience on Windows, copy the OptiX dlls into the build directories, so OptiX
#    doesn't have to be in the path to run the samples.
#
# 5. Set a CMake variable that indicates we have configured for the first time.  This
#    allows us to override and set varibles' defaults while allowing them to be modified
#    later.

# If you have any questions, don't feel shy about posting to the OptiX forums:
# https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/board/90/


# This sets up the name of our project.  For our purposes the main thing this controls is
# the name of the VS solution file.

# This enforces a particular version of CMake that we require to process the script files
# properly.  We rely on CXX_STANDARD, which was added in CMake 3.1.
